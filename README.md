# American-College-Football-Network-Analysis-Exploring-Interactions-and-Community-Detection

This project focuses on analyzing the network of American football games between Division IA colleges during the Fall 2000 regular season. The dataset used in this project is sourced from the study conducted by M. Girvan and M. E. J. Newman (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 99, 7821-7826, 2002).

## Project Tasks
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Description:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Provide a comprehensive description of the social network of football players using the provided dataset. Use NetworkX to read the data from .gml or .txt files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Visualization:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Visualize the social network to gain insights at a glance. Interpret and describe the patterns, connections, and overall structure of the network.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Network Structure and Statistics:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Analyze the structure of the network and calculate various network statistics, such as the number of nodes, edges, average degree, average shortest path distance, degree distribution, density, eccentricity, Wiener index, and clustering coefficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Clustering vs. Degree:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Plot the clustering coefficient against the degree of nodes and provide an explanation for the observed relationship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Student Interactions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Discuss what this social network can reveal about the interactions among students. Identify any significant patterns or findings that emerge from the network analysis.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Improving Predictability:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Share your thoughts on potential measures to enhance the predictability power of constructing the social network. Discuss possible improvements or additional data sources that could be utilized.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Centrality Measures and Community Detection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Perform centrality measures (e.g., degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality) on the social network. Explain the significance of these measures in understanding the network's dynamics.</li>
<li>Utilize community detection algorithms in NetworkX to identify communities within the network. Assess whether these communities reflect the reality of student interactions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Influence on Student Grades:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Investigate the potential influence of this social network on the final grades of students. Discuss and explain any connections or relationships that may exist between the social network and academic performance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
